# Forecasting-Store-Order
To ensure that there will always be sufficient stock supply to meet customer demand, this project uses time series analysis to forecast future order one month ahead of time. This allows the store to prepare for increasing demand should there be a lack of stock, and prevents surplus of stock in the store, which can lead to capital loss.
